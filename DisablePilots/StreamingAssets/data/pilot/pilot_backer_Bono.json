        "Details": "Tony Bono has no memory of his parents, who were a gladiatorial duo on Solaris VII, and who died particularly memorable deaths that are still occasionally referenced today. He was raised by the techs and other gladiators in the stable, growing up on stories of the valor and celebrity of his parents and other famous arena champions.\r\n\r\nWhen he was eighteen, despite the wishes of his favorite auntie, he decided to officially join the stable as a gladiator instead of a tech. He was an excellent duelist, able to make any fight not just entertaining but actually exciting, but his temperament was too serious. He found he was unable to showboat in a way that garnered more than passing media attention, despite his family background.\r\n\r\nUnable to convince himself to move from piloting a 'Mech to repairing them, no matter what his stable aunties hoped, he eventually withdrew entirely from gladiatorial life. After traveling a while on the farewell gift of his adopted family, he headed to the Periphery, where his grim focus on winning small-scale battles has served him well as a MechWarrior-for-hire.",
