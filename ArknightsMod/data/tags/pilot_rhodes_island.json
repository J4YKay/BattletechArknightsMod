	"Description" : "Based on an approximately 800 meter-long landship – a much smaller version of nomadic cities – of the same name complete with airpads and farms currently located in the area between Ursus, Kazdel, and Lungmen, Rhodes Island dedicated themselves to develop treatments and a possible cure to Oripathy which has plagued Terra since the advent of the Catastrophes. However, they also have to deal with the problems associated with it, such as social discrimination against the Infected, which is why R.I. possesses a paramilitary force to provide security for their personnel and patients as well as providing combat support should the need arise."
