	"Description" : "Kazimierz, formally referred to as Kingdom of Kazimierz, is a country located between Kjerag, Sami, Ursus, and Victoria. Kazimierz is mostly covered with forests with small mountain ranges, and most Kazimierzians live in small, isolated villages – a rare sight of sedentary settlements in the Catastrophe-ridden Terra – whose development are often overlooked by the Kazimierzian government in favor of larger towns and cities, causing the villages to suffer from poverty more than the rest of the country."
